Starting a log because I may as well!
Currently I have basic player movement, a weapon, and that's it...
Now I'm gonna work on the level generator.

Oct 1 15:14

Just ate lunch after getting the basics of the level generator implemented.
I have discovered that the way the generator works - storing pieces in BMP files - does not work with GM's HTML5 support. Annoying!

Oct 1 15:21

Level generator now randomly spawns zombies.

Oct 1 15:37

Added more pieces including arena2 and the jails.
There's a bug in which 2-wide connectors leave a hole.

Oct 1 15:39

Moved most debug stuff under a global.debug variable

Oct 1 15:41

TAB and SHIFT now activate noclip and double speed in debug mode

Oct 1 15:57

Walls now generate an obj_wall entity too. This is ineffecient but greatly simplifies collision code...

Oct 1 16:00

Bullets now finally die upon hitting walls

Oct 1 17:21

Spent the last 1.5 hours fiddling with world gen and stuff. Think it's mostly okay now.
Next up: motion planning and actual gameplay.

Oct 1 18:00

Been working on NPC and player interactions: zombies now pathfind towards the player and the player can now die.

Oct 1 18:20

Added a death screen, although it doesn't actually accept input.
Probably gonna go for a walk now. Hope I don't get rained on.
GameMaker is using 4 GB of RAM, wtf?

Oct 1 20:52

Went on an hour-long walk, got rained on.
Came back and fixed the HTML5 version; pieces are now stored in a custom text-based format.
New bug though: you can shoot yourself.

Oct 1 20:55

Think I've fixed that by comparing object IDs. Now I need to shower, then add more gameplay stuffs.
Difficulty scaling and not spawning zombies on the player is a good start.
Some debug info for HTML5 too.

Oct 1 21:22 

I have showered, and also discovered that my custom image decoder is bugged. BMP works fine, the text format
is generating garbage.

Oct 1 21:50

AI now checks for distance /before/ line of sight, significantly improving performance

Oct 1 22:00

Reduced the room size from 4096 to 1024. 4096 was excessive.

Oct 1 22:01

Spawn is now placed dead centre.

Oct 1 22:03

Zombies now only spawn > 7 tiles away from spawn.

Oct 2 00:15

Finished the shader so it looks /less/ awful. Also at some point I redid the HUD.
